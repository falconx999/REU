Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. symptoms of lung cancer typically occur when the disease is advanced. Early diagnosis  permits patients to have treatment options and increase survival rate. In this   project, we have developed various deep learning based models for the detection and classification  of lung cancer from histopathological images.
